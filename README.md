# farnet-acd
Experimental Amazon Cloud Drive FarNet module

## TODO
* F6 support from and to the module panel
* (partially done) Handling situations when the remote server is not working properly (sometimes it can return 503)
* Partial file upload indication
* Ask to delete or keep partially downloaded file
* Overwrite confirmation dialog during download
* (partially done) Proper Exception handling (at least prevent Far crashes)

## Possible further extension
* Trash display
* Support for untrashing files
* Folder Tree display
* Multiple ACD accounts support
* Multiple services support (not just ACD)
