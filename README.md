# farnet-acd
Experimental pCloud FarNet module

## What and why
This module is based on the Amazon Cloud Drive FarNet module (and is a hard fork of it). 
As Amazon is not willing to provide public API for the users of their service, the original module now makes no sense. 
PCloud seems to be more loyal to their users in this sense.

Yet, as this plugin is based on the ACD FarNet module there still lots of signs of Amazon, but in fact this plugin does not have anything common with Amazon Cloud Drive anymore (except common roots with the original module).

## TODO
* F6 support from and to the module panel
* Panel: Partial file upload indication
* Export Files: Ask for the path where to copy the files
* Request Client ID and Client Secret on first panel open

## Possible further extension
* Share/Unshare files via menu
* Show extended file information via menu
* Ask to delete or keep partially downloaded file
* (for directories) Merge confirmation dialog during download
* Trash display
* Support for untrashing files
* Folder Tree display
* Multiple pCloud accounts support
